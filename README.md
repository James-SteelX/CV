Full stack junior developer

Former Sous Chef and a recent graduate of Europes number one web developer bootcamp, Makers Academy Remote. I am looking for a full stack junior developer role where I can continue to push myself and further my learning. I decided on a career change after I realised I was more interested on the process of cooking and working out why I'm doing certain things rather than necessarily the end product. I'm ideally looking for a backend role where I can get into some really interesting projects.


#Skills

##Team Player

Having been a chef for 9 years i'm very used to working as part of team, delivering a high quality product on time and communicating with my peers. Also being a Sous Chef for the past 3 years has given me experience leading a team in a high pressure environment as well as delegating tasks and managing work load.

##Patience

Being a chef has set me up well for the fast pace environment of web development. Working under intense pressure is second nature to me, and I have often been praised for my ability to keep a level head and on task even during the busiest periods.  

##Dedication

I've had one job for 9 years. On top of that I have graduated from the toughest and most exclusive developer bootcamp in Europe, which required me to forget everything else in life and completely dedicate myself to learning for 12 weeks. During the course I myself and a team of 5 other people built a Django/Python web blog in 5 days having had no previous interaction with Python or Django. I also tacked a meteor project for my finally project knowing that Javascript was one of my weaknesses but ended the project with a much better understanding of how Javascript and Meteor work.

* Cooking (I make a mean chilli)

* Cars (I'm a keen amateur mechanic and in the past i've built an Audi engined VW golf and helped in the restoration of a 1970s Beetle.)
* Travel (specifically to watch football, I went to Dortmund to watch the Ruhr Derby which was incredible and was out in Lille for the Euros.)
